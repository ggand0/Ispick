      <strong>What is this site?</strong><br />
        Ispick is a website that gathers anime artworks automatically. You can browse images with the pinterest-like layout, based on RSS streams, or simply on tag search results. Also, you can create your own image feed by registering to our site.<br />

      <strong>Why does it fail to scroll when I browse on Chrome?</strong><br />
         This is a broser side bug and is fixed in version 40, as following stackoverflow page describes:
        <%= link_to 'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26408931/bizarre-error-in-chrome-developer-console-failed-to-load-resource-neterr-ca'.html_safe, 'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26408931/bizarre-error-in-chrome-developer-console-failed-to-load-resource-neterr-ca' %> <br /><br />
         To address this problem, you can use other browsers like Firefox, or you can try <%= link_to 'Chrome 40 beta', 'http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.jp/'.html_safe %>.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Are you going to increase the number of sites?</strong><br />
        Yes, currently we're planning to add deviantART, Pixiv, Nicoseiga, and other image board style websites.<br /><br />
