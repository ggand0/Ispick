      <strong>Why does it fail to load images with infinite scroll when I browse on Chrome?</strong><br />
         This is a broser side bug and is fixed in version 40, as following stackoverflow page describes:
        <%= link_to '<u>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26408931/bizarre-error-in-chrome-developer-console-failed-to-load-resource-neterr-ca</u>'.html_safe, 'http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26408931/bizarre-error-in-chrome-developer-console-failed-to-load-resource-neterr-ca' %> <br /><br />
         To address this problem, you can use other browsers like Firefox, or you can try <%= link_to '<u>Chrome 40 beta</u>'.html_safe, 'http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.jp/'.html_safe %>.<br />

      <strong>How can I turn on pagination?</strong><br />

      <strong>Are you going to increase the number of sites?</strong><br />
